This method was chosen because it's more efficient way to resolve such tasks.
It's time complexity is O(n) because we need to iterate over n elements  and space complexity is O(n) because we need to add n elements into Set and Queue. The Set was chosen because it stores only unique elements and the Queue was chosen because we need to keep order of String elements (chars). Stack data structure can be used insted of Queue but then we need to reverse elements in StringBuilder.
